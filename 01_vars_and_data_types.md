# Variables and Data Types

## Declaration and assignment

Variables are used to store values in JavaScript. To declare a variable, you use the var, let, or const keyword. For example:

```javascript
var name = "John";
let age = 25;
const PI = 3.14;
```

## Primitive data types

JavaScript has several primitive data types, including strings, numbers, and booleans. Here are examples:

```javascript
let name = "John";  // string
let age = 25;      // number
let isStudent = true;  // boolean
```

## Complex data types

JavaScript also has complex data types, such as objects, arrays, and functions. Here's an example of an object:

```javascript
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
  isStudent: true
};
```
