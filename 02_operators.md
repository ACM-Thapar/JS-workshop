# Operators

## Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations. Examples include:

```javascript
let a = 5 + 3;  // addition
let b = 10 - 4;  // subtraction
let c = 4 * 2;  // multiplication
let d = 10 / 3;  // division
let e = 10 % 3;  // modulus (remainder)
```

## Comparison operators

Comparison operators compare values and return a boolean. Examples include:

```javascript
let a = 5 > 3;  // greater than
let b = 10 <= 4;  // less than or equal to
let c = 4 === 4;  // equal to (strict equality)
let d = 10 !== 3;  // not equal to (strict inequality)
```

## Logical operators

Logical operators are used to combine or negate conditions. Examples include:

```javascript
let a = (5 > 3) && (10 < 4);  // logical AND
let b = (5 > 3) || (10 < 4);  // logical OR
let c = !(5 > 3);  // logical NOT
```

## Ternary operator

The ternary operator provides a concise way to write conditional statements. Example:

```javascript
let age = 17;
let message = (age >= 18) ? "You can vote" : "You cannot vote";
console.log(message);  // Output: "You cannot vote"
```
